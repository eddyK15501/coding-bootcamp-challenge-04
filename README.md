# Timed Trivia Quiz

## Description
In this weeks project, we were asked to create a timed trivia quiz from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. You begin by clicking the "Start Quiz" button. A timer, located on the upper right corner of the screen, will begin counting down, indicate the number of seconds left to complete the quiz. Trivia questions relating to JavaScript will be queued. If the question is answered correctly, the timer will continue to countdown as expected. If the question is answered incorrectly, the timer will decrease by an additional ten seconds. When the quiz is completed, you will be prompted to enter an initial to go along with your final score. The final score equates to number of seconds left on the timer when the quiz was completed. Submit your initials, and you will be taken to a high score results page. There, you will see a list of high scores to go along with initials.

### User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
